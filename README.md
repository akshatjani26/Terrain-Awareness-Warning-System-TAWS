## Modelling of Terrain Awareness & Warning System (TAWS) for fixed-wing aircraft ## 

# Abstract: 
In this project, Terrain Awareness & Warning System (TAWS), a system responsible for guiding aircraft safely into the terrain is modelled, analyzed, and simulated using MATLAB & Simulink. Firstly, the Virtual Reality (VR) environment is created by generating terrain using the elevation values extracted from an open-source terrain database and adding an aircraft controllable through Simulink. Secondly, an algorithm to predict the aircraft’s position after a specified time interval is developed. It also extracts and returns the terrain elevation value at the predicted position which is compared with the aircraft’s altitude. Finally, suitable aural and visual warnings are generated and displayed in the animation window based on the comparison. The idea of visual warnings where a miniature aircraft can be seen blinking with red color along with the warning message can be implemented in the real-time multifunctional displays in the cockpit. This provides more instant stimuli about the danger to the crew, giving them more time to react.
